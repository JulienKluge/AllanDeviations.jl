"""
timedev(data, rate; [frequency=false], [overlapping=true], [taus=Octave])
Calculates the time deviation

#parameters:
* `<data>`:			The data array to calculate the deviation from either as as phases or frequencies.
* `<rate>`:			The rate of the data given.
* `[frequency]`:		True if `data` contains frequency data otherwise (default) phase data is assumed.
* `[overlapping]`:	True (default) to calculate overlapping deviation, false otherwise.
* `[taus]`:			Taus to calculate the deviation at. This can either be an AllanTauDescriptor type `AllTaus, Decadade, HalfDecade, Octave, HalfOctave, QuarterOctave`, an array of taus to calculate at, a float number to build a custom log-scale on or an integer to build a specific number of log spaced points.

#returns: named tupple (tau, deviation, error, count)
* `tau`:		Taus which where used.
* `deviation`:	Deviations calculated.
* `error`:		Respective errors.
* `count`:		Number of contributing terms for each deviation.
